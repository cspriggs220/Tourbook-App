<h1>Tourbook App</h1>
<hr>
<p>This is my personal capstone project for the Nashville Software School. I'm building an app for use by touring musicians; to provide a convenient place to view information regarding all upcoming shows.</p>
<p>This app can be viewed at: https://tourbook-ich4w.backliftapp.com/</p>
<p><em>I would also like to thank my mentor Pete Brumm for his patience, direction, and wisdom in helping me build this app.</em></p>
